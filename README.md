# From-Basics-to-Advanced-Health-Analytics-Exploring-Diabetes-Data
This repository hosts the materials for Principles of Data Analysis in R, a teaching project developed for R-Ladies Rome workshops and events.

The tutorial uses a simulated diabetes dataset observed at two time points (2015 and 2025) to demonstrate a complete, reproducible data analysis workflow in R. The content covers:
	•	Data import and preprocessing
	•	Data inspection and transformation
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Summary statistics and prevalence estimation
	•	Data visualization with ggplot2
	•	Qualitative statistical inference using categorical tests

The focus is on methodology, workflow, and interpretation, making the material suitable for beginners and early-career analysts.
All data are synthetic and used solely for teaching purposes.
