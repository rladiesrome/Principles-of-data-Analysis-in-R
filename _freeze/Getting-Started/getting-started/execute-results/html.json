This guide is designed to help beginners set up their R programming environment and get familiar with the basics of R and RStudio.\n\n## Installing R and RStudio\n\n1. **Install R**: \n\n   - Go to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/) and download the latest version of R for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.\n2. **Install RStudio**:\n\n   - Visit the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)\n   - Download the free version of RStudio Desktop and install it on your computer.\n3. **Launch RStudio**: Open RStudio after installation. You should see the RStudio interface with multiple panes.\n\n\n## RStudio Interface Overview\n\nThe RStudio interface consists of several key panes:\n\n- **Source Pane**: This is where you can write and edit your R scripts and R Markdown documents.\n- **Console Pane**: This is where you can type and execute R commands directly.\n- **Environment/History Pane**: This pane shows the variables and data frames in your current R session, as well as a history of commands you've executed.\n- **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer Pane**: This pane allows you to navigate files, view plots, manage packages, access help documentation, and view web content.\n\n## Writing Your First R Script  \n\n1. In the Source Pane, click on \"File\" > \"New File\" > \"R Script\" to create a new R script.\n\n2. Type the following code into the script:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2+2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n3. To run the code, highlight the line and click the \"Run\" button or press `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac). You should see the output `4` in the Console Pane.\n\n## Installing and Loading Packages\n\nR has a vast ecosystem of packages that extend its functionality. To install and load packages, follow these steps:\n\n1. To install a package, use the `install.packages()` function. For example,\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n```\n:::\n\n2. To load a package into your R session, use the `library()` function:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Basic R Commands\n\nHere are some basic R commands to get you started:\n\n- Assigning values to variables:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 10\ny <- 5\n```\n:::\n\n- Performing arithmetic operations:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum <- x + y\nproduct <- x * y\n```\n:::\n\n- Creating a vector:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n```\n:::\n\n- Viewing the contents of a variable:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(my_vector)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you have set up R and RStudio and learned some basic commands, you can explore more advanced topics in R programming and data analysis.
