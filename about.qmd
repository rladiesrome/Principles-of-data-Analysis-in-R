title: "About Us"
---

We teach R as a tool for data analysis, not as an abstract programming language. Our sessions focus on clear workflows, reproducible analysis, and interpretation of results using real-world examples.

The project is curated by [Rafaela Ribeiro Lucas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelagrlucas/), [Federica Gazzelloni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicagazzelloni/), and [Lucy Michaels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucymichaels/). Together, we combine experience in statistics, data science, and applied research to deliver practical, accessible, and methodologically sound R training.
