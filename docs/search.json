    "text": "Pre-processing\nThe pre-processing phase is crucial for ensuring the quality and integrity of the data before conducting any analysis. Data are often messy and may contain inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information that can affect the results of the analysis.\nData Manipulation\nCombine data for comparative analyses by year is straightforward, we stack the two datasets into a single table and add a year column. This is data manipulation; we merge the two datasets from 2015 and 2025 into a single dataset, adding a new column to indicate the year of each observation.\nIn particular, we use the bind_rows function from the dplyr package to stack the two datasets vertically, and the mutate function to create a new column called year.\n\ndata_raw &lt;- bind_rows(\n  d2015 |&gt; mutate(year = 2015),\n  d2025 |&gt; mutate(year = 2025))\n\nData Inspection\nThe first step is to check the initial structure of the data and identify any missing values. We can use the head function to view the first few rows of the dataset.\n\n# Checking initial structure\nhead(data_raw)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n   year country   age sex   bmi_cat       sdi     lab_hba1c diabetes_self_report\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n1  2015 Brazil     42 woman Obesity       Interm…       4.9 no                  \n2  2015 Brazil     64 woman Normal weight Interm…       6.1 no                  \n3  2015 Brazil     82 woman Obesity       Interm…       4.8 no                  \n4  2015 Brazil     55 woman Normal weight Interm…       6   no                  \n5  2015 Brazil     59 woman Underweight   Interm…       5.6 no                  \n6  2015 Brazil     42 men   Normal weight Interm…       6.3 no                  \n# ℹ 1 more variable: gestational_diabetes &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nThen, we perform data inspection with the str or glimpse functions to understand the data types and structure of each variable.

This function returns a logical matrix indicating the presence of missing values in the dataset. To count the number of missing values in each column, we can use the colSums function in combination with is.na.\n\n# Checking missing values (NA)\ncolSums(is.na(data_raw))\n\n                year              country                  age \n                   0                    0                    0 \n                 sex              bmi_cat                  sdi \n                   0                    0                    0 \n           lab_hba1c diabetes_self_report gestational_diabetes \n                   0                    0                    0 \n\n\nThere aren’t missing values in the dataset, but if there were, we could handle them using various strategies such as imputation, removal, or flagging, depending on the nature and extent of the missing data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteQuestion\n\n\n\nHow would you handle missing values in a dataset? What strategies would you consider?\n\n\nCreating Derived Variables\nData are usually not in the exact format needed for analysis. Therefore, we create new variables based on existing ones to facilitate the analysis. We are looking at making comparisons between two years to see how diabetes level changes along the time.\nIn this case , we create three derived variables:\n\nLaboratory-defined diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 6.5)\nTotal diabetes (self-report OR laboratory, excluding gestational diabetes)\nAge groups (set of age bands to support grouped summaries)\n\nThis step involves using the mutate function from the dplyr package to create new columns based on conditions applied to existing columns. And we use the if_else and case_when functions to define the logic for these new variables.\n\ndiabetes_data &lt;- data_raw |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    diabetes_lab = if_else(lab_hba1c &gt;= 6.5, \"yes\", \"no\", missing = NA_character_),\n    diabetes_total = case_when(\n      gestational_diabetes == \"yes\" ~ \"no\",\n      diabetes_self_report == \"yes\" | diabetes_lab == \"yes\" ~ \"yes\",\n      TRUE ~ \"no\"\n    ),\n    age_group = case_when(\n      age &lt; 50 ~ \"40–49\",\n      age &lt; 60 ~ \"50–59\",\n      TRUE ~ \"60+\"\n    )\n  )",

R is used as a support for analysis, not as an end in itself.\nThis series of guides aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the principles of data analysis using R. Each guide focuses on a specific aspect of data analysis, from data cleaning and manipulation to visualization and statistical modelling.
